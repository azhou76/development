This project was created as part of the CSCI 1300 Development project. This website specifically allows users to look at some regional restaurants around Brown University's campus and filter, sort, and favorite them in search of their next spot to eat.

Notes:

- For the purposes of the distance filter, a walkable distance is anything within 1.0 miles of campus, a bikeable distance is anything within 3.0 miles of campus, and a driveable distance is anything within 120 miles of campus.
- Not all metrics (i.e. average entree price, distance, food options) are necessarily accurate to reality. Some were chosen to provide a breadth of options for the filtering and sorting choices.

To run this project locally, run npm install (if first time running) in terminal, followed by npm start.

There are no known bugs in the implementation.
